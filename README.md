# Crypto Dashboard: Built with Pure JavaScript 

This project was a deep dive into front-end development, focusing on real-time data visualization and responsive design without the aid of frameworks. Initially I built out the design using HTML & CSS before building out functionality using Vanilla JS in conjunction with the free CoinGecko API.
